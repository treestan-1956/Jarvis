**Neurodivergent Executive Function Prosthesis**

An AI-augmented personal OS designed to give neurodivergent individuals the cognitive stability, automation, and metabolic predictability needed to thrive.

## Overview

Jarvis is a 24/7 compensatory cognitive scaffold for individuals with AUDHD, autism, POTS, MCAS, EDS, and CPTSD. It combines automation, prediction, tracking, and emotional modeling to:

- Regulate physiological load
- Manage tasks based on current capacity
- Track symptoms and patterns
- Predict flares before they happen
- Offer personalized interventions
- Reduce cognitive overhead

## Core Features

### Executive Function Prosthesis
- Auto-prioritize tasks by energy cost
- "Today's capacity" suggestions
- Minimum viable day mode
- Auto-reschedule when flares detected

### Symptom Tracking
- Energy, fatigue, pain, brain fog
- GI symptoms, hydration, electrolytes
- Sleep patterns and HRV
- Environmental triggers
- Multiple input modalities (quick-taps, voice, passive sensors)

### Neuroimmune Budget System
Real-time "budget" display showing current capacity:
- Green (functional)
- Yellow (caution)
- Red (risk of crash)

### Flare Prediction Engine
Predicts flares 4-48 hours in advance using pattern recognition across:
- Symptom trends
- Environmental conditions
- Sleep and task load
- Food logs and heart rate patterns

### Daily Recommendations
- Predicted energy levels
- Hydration schedule
- Safe food suggestions
- Pacing guide
- "Do these 3 things and the day will go well"

## Design Philosophy

**The system should feel like a calm intelligence that believes in you and wants you to win.**

- Minimal, soft-color UI with low sensory load
- Nonjudgmental language that respects capacity limits
- No guilt, no moral language, no "failed streaks"
- Works even in low-capacity states
- Adapts to nonlinear energy rhythms

## Privacy

- User-owned data
- No cloud dependency unless user opts in
- Local encryption
- Fully exportable data
