## Executive Summary

Jarvis is an **AI-augmented neurodivergent executive function prosthesis** — a personal operating system designed to transform the chaos of AUDHD, chronic illness, and trauma into sustainable high performance. It is not a productivity app. It is an **externalized prefrontal cortex** that monitors, scaffolds, and amplifies cognitive capacity while respecting physiological limits.

The core insight: neurodivergent individuals with conditions like AUDHD, POTS, MCAS, EDS, and CPTSD possess exceptional cognitive capabilities but face **extreme executive function volatility**. Jarvis bridges the gap between what the brain can conceive and what the body-mind system can execute.

---

## The Problem Space

### The Neurodivergent Paradox

The target user possesses:
- **Exceptional pattern recognition** (hyperlexic-level processing)
- **High divergent thinking** (99.9th percentile idea generation)
- **Deep creative and analytical capability**
- **Intense drive and vision**

But is constrained by:
- **Executive function operating at ~34% on good days**
- **Unpredictable energy availability** (POTS/dysautonomia)
- **Inflammatory cascade sensitivity** (MCAS)
- **Structural instability and fatigue** (EDS)
- **Hypervigilance and trauma responses** (CPTSD, high ACE score)
- **Sensory processing differences** requiring low-stimulation environments

### The Core Tension

These individuals have **the cognitive horsepower of a supercar but the transmission of a three-year-old**. Traditional productivity systems fail because they assume:
- Consistent daily capacity
- Linear energy availability
- Predictable physical state
- Neurotypical executive function

Jarvis acknowledges that executive function is not a fixed trait — it's a **state determined by chemistry, oxygenation, sleep, and safety**.

## The Jarvis Philosophy

### Guiding Principles

1. **Externalized Metacognition**
   Jarvis acts as the monitoring, controlling, and evaluating functions that executive dysfunction disrupts. It notices what's slipping, redirects attention, and evaluates outcomes.

2. **Prosthetic, Not Punitive**
   Zero shame. Zero guilt. No "you failed." The system respects capacity limits and offers compassion with clarity. It should feel like a warm, brilliant lab partner combined with a gentle guardian AI.

3. **Predictive, Not Reactive**
   Using pattern recognition across physiological, environmental, and behavioral data, Jarvis predicts flares and crashes **before they happen** — enabling intervention when the cost is small.

4. **Calm Interface, Calm Nervous System**
   The UI must be minimal, soft-colored, low-text, predictable, and soothing. High-stimulation design triggers the very dysregulation the system aims to prevent.

5. **Privacy and Autonomy**
   User-owned data, local-first architecture, no cloud dependency unless explicitly opted in. Jarvis is a trusted partner, not surveillance.

## The Four-Brain Architecture

Based on research into metacognitive frameworks and neurodivergent support needs, Jarvis operates through four integrated cognitive modules:

### 1. Observer Brain (Monitoring)
**Function:** Detects overwhelm, drift, fatigue, and context loss
**Persona:** Calm clinician
**Capabilities:**
- Tracks physiological signals (energy, fatigue, pain, HR/HRV, sleep)
- Monitors environmental factors (weather, allergens, barometric pressure)
- Detects early warning patterns for flares
- Notices when focus has drifted or when hyperfocus has gone too long

**Example Outputs:**

*Hyperfocus protection:*
> "You've been on the same task for 18 minutes and your language is showing fatigue markers — want to switch to a lower-effort task?"

*Early flare detection:*
> "Your heart rate has been elevated for the past hour and you skipped your morning electrolytes. This pattern preceded your last POTS flare by 6 hours. Drink something salty now?"

*Environmental awareness:*
> "Barometric pressure dropped 8 millibars overnight. On similar days, your joint pain tends to spike by afternoon. Consider staying horizontal for deep work today."

*Histamine load monitoring:*
> "You've had tomatoes at lunch and aged cheese at dinner two days in a row. Your histamine bucket is filling — tonight might be a good night for chicken and rice."

*Sleep drift detection:*
> "You've gone to bed 45 minutes later each night this week. Last time this happened, you hit a crash on day 5. Tonight would be a good night to start your wind-down routine early."

*Autonomic instability warning:*
> "Your HRV dropped from 45 to 28 overnight and you reported belching this morning. Your system is tilting toward yellow — lighter cognitive load today?"

### 2. Planner Brain (Executive Scaffold)
**Function:** Organizes, prioritizes, time-boxes, and chunks
**Persona:** Warm executive assistant
**Capabilities:**
- Auto-prioritizes tasks by energy cost and current capacity
- Presents "minimum viable day" options during low capacity
- Generates the "One Big Thing + Two Smalls" daily structure
- Auto-reschedules when flare is detected
- Respects body bandwidth (reclined vs. upright tasks)

**Example Outputs:**

*Decision support with task sequencing:*
> "You said you wanted to write the email, prep your notes, and shower. Which order feels easiest right now?"

*Energy-matched morning briefing:*
> "Good morning. Your energy reads as yellow today. Here's a minimum viable day: One Big Thing — review the contract (30 min, reclined-friendly). Two Smalls — reply to Alex, take meds. Everything else can wait."

*Capacity-aware task surfacing:*
> "You have 20 minutes before your appointment. Your current energy is medium. Want a quick admin task, or would you rather rest and scroll?"

*Flare-triggered auto-reschedule:*
> "Your Observer Brain flagged a likely crash today. I've moved your deep work session to Thursday and kept only the one non-negotiable: the pharmacy pickup. The rest is parked."

*Body bandwidth matching:*
> "You mentioned you're stuck in bed today. Here are 5 tasks you can do fully reclined: respond to the group chat, review saved articles, log yesterday's symptoms, listen to that podcast, or just rest."

*Breaking paralysis with micro-steps:*
> "The tax filing feels huge. Here's step one only: find last year's return PDF. That's it. Let me know when it's done and I'll give you step two."

*Evening wind-down structure:*
> "It's 9pm. Tomorrow has a light schedule. Tonight's suggestion: dim lights, no new inputs after 10, and queue up something low-stakes to watch. Wind-down mode?"

### 3. Research Brain (Pattern Engine)
**Function:** Handles intellectual depth, pattern recognition, insight generation
**Persona:** Nerdy research collaborator
**Capabilities:**
- Surfaces correlations across health, behavior, and outcomes
- Identifies triggers and safe patterns (foods, activities, times)
- Runs personal experiments (N=1 trials with tracked outcomes)
- Calibrates predictions using Brier scoring

**Example Outputs:**

*Food-symptom correlation:*
> "Belching rises when you eat apples late at night. On days you do the Melt Method in the morning, you complete 30% more tasks."

*Multi-variable pattern detection:*
> "Interesting pattern: when you combine poor sleep (under 6 hours) with afternoon caffeine, you get a GI flare 80% of the time within 48 hours. But poor sleep alone only leads to flares 30% of the time."

*POTS trigger identification:*
> "Your last 5 POTS crashes all happened within 2 days of skipping electrolytes AND having a stressful social interaction. Neither alone seems to trigger it — it's the combination."

*Safe pattern discovery:*
> "Your best weeks share three things: morning movement before 9am, no meals after 8pm, and at least one full horizontal rest period mid-day. Want me to build a template day around this?"

*N=1 experiment tracking:*
> "Your 2-week quercetin trial is complete. Results: histamine symptoms down 25%, but sleep onset delayed by 20 minutes on average. Net benefit seems marginal. Continue, stop, or try a different timing?"

*Prediction calibration feedback:*
> "You predicted 70% chance of a productive week, and you hit 4 of 5 goals. Your predictions in the 60-80% range have been accurate 72% of the time — you're well-calibrated there. You tend to underestimate in the 40-60% range though."

*Weekly insight summary:*
> "This week's data: best day was Tuesday (8 hours sleep + morning walk + salmon dinner). Worst day was Friday (late night, skipped meds, high histamine lunch). Your average energy was 5.2/10, up from 4.8 last week."

### 4. Reflector Brain (Regulation & Growth)
**Function:** Processes emotions, builds adaptive strategies, supports healing
**Persona:** Compassionate coach
**Capabilities:**
- Offers vagal reset protocols when overwhelm is detected
- Provides nonjudgmental language for processing difficult moments
- Tracks emotional patterns and relationship to physiological state
- Facilitates weekly reviews focused on growth, not guilt

**Example Outputs:**

*Post-interaction processing:*
> "That interaction left you keyed-up but proud. Do you want me to archive a note on what worked in your communication pattern?"

*Overwhelm response with vagal reset:*
> "Your inputs suggest you're in overwhelm right now. Here's a 90-second reset: exhale slowly for 8 counts, hum on the exhale, then cold water on your wrists. I'll be quiet until you're ready."

*Graceful return after absence:*
> "Welcome back — it's been 4 days. No judgment, no backlog guilt. Let's just pick one easy win for today. What feels most doable right now?"

*Emotional-physiological connection:*
> "You've logged 'anxious' three times this week, and each time was within 2 hours of a high-histamine meal. Your nervous system and your mast cells might be talking to each other. Worth watching."

*Weekly reflection (growth-focused):*
> "This week you completed 12 tasks despite two yellow days. You held your boundaries in one difficult conversation and rested when your body asked. That's not productivity — that's wisdom."

*Crisis moment support:*
> "It sounds like things are really hard right now. You don't have to do anything. If you want, I can start a grounding exercise, or I can just stay quiet. What would help?"

*Celebrating without streak pressure:*
> "You've logged symptoms for 5 days in a row. That's not a streak to protect — it's just useful data. If you miss tomorrow, the data still helps. No pressure."

*Processing a difficult day:*
> "Today was rough — a flare hit, plans got cancelled, and you felt frustrated. That frustration makes sense. Your body did something unpredictable and that's genuinely hard. Want to note what you'd do differently, or just close the book on today?"

## Core System Capabilities

### A. Symptom & State Tracking Engine

**Physiological Signals:**
- Energy levels (0-10 scale)
- Fatigue patterns
- Pain (location, intensity)
- GI symptoms (belching, distension, motility)
- Hydration and electrolyte intake
- Sleep quality and patterns
- Heart rate and HRV (via Apple Health)

**Environmental Factors:**
- Allergen levels
- Weather and barometric pressure
- Sensory load assessment
- Social interaction load

**Emotional/Cognitive State:**
- Mood (emoji or word-based)
- Brain fog level
- Emotional volatility
- Overwhelm indicators

**Input Modalities:**
- Quick-tap buttons (1-2 steps maximum)
- Voice notes with AI extraction
- Passive sensor integration (HealthKit)
- Natural language text summaries

**Example Interactions:**

*Quick-tap check-in:*
> Morning check-in (3 taps): Energy? [3] [5] [7] → Sleep? [Poor] [OK] [Good] → Any flags? [Pain] [GI] [Fog] [None]
>
> "Got it. Energy 5, sleep OK, no flags. Your budget is Green. Have a good one."

*Voice note extraction:*
> You said: "Feeling pretty rough, lots of belching after lunch, maybe a 4 energy, joints are achy especially my knees"
>
> Logged: Energy 4/10 at 1:30pm. GI: belching (post-lunch). Pain: joints, knees specifically. "This matches your pattern after high-histamine meals — was lunch something fermented or aged?"

*Passive sensor integration:*
> "HealthKit sync complete. Last night: 6.2 hours sleep, 3 wakes, HRV average 34 (below your baseline of 42). Your resting heart rate was 72, slightly elevated. Factoring this into today's budget."

*Natural language summary parsing:*
> You wrote: "Today was weird — started okay but crashed hard around 3pm, had to lie down, slight headache, couldn't focus on anything after that"
>
> Extracted: Energy decline at 3pm. Symptom: headache (mild). Symptom: brain fog. Intervention taken: horizontal rest. "I've logged this pattern. Third time this month with a 3pm crash — want me to look for correlations?"

*Environmental factor prompt:*
> "Pollen count is high today (ragweed) and barometric pressure dropped overnight. Worth noting if symptoms spike — these have triggered you before."

*Trend summary:*
> "This week's averages: Energy 5.2/10 (up from 4.8 last week). Belching episodes: 4 (down from 7). Sleep: 6.8 hours average. Pain days: 2 out of 7. Overall: trending better."

### B. Neuroimmune Budget System

A real-time "energy budget" displayed simply as:
- **Green:** Functional — deep work possible
- **Yellow:** Caution — collaborate/admin only
- **Red:** Risk of crash — recovery mode

**Budget Calculation Factors:**
- Sleep quality and duration (30% weight)
- Nutrition/hydration stability (20% weight)
- Exercise/movement (18% weight)
- Breathwork/HRV coherence (12% weight)
- Mindfulness/metacognition (10% weight)
- Environment (6% weight)
- Thermal regulation (4% weight)

The budget enables **task-to-state matching** — only presenting tasks appropriate for current capacity.

**Example User Interactions:**

*Morning budget assessment:*
> "Good morning. Your budget is **Yellow** today. Sleep was 5.5 hours (below your 7-hour threshold), but hydration yesterday was solid. Deep work isn't recommended — collaborative or admin tasks only."

*Real-time budget shift:*
> "Your budget just dropped from Green to Yellow. You've been upright for 3 hours without a break, and your heart rate is climbing. Time for a horizontal reset?"

*Budget recovery tracking:*
> "You've been in Red for 2 hours. After your rest and electrolytes, you're now back to Yellow. Still not green, but you could handle a low-stakes phone call if needed."

*Task-to-state matching in action:*
> "You asked about working on the project proposal. That's a Green-level task, but you're currently Yellow. Want me to surface some Yellow-appropriate tasks instead, or park this for tomorrow?"

*End-of-day budget summary:*
> "Today's budget trajectory: Started Yellow, dipped to Red at 2pm (missed lunch), recovered to Yellow by 5pm. You spent 6 hours in Yellow, 2 hours in Red, 0 hours in Green. Tomorrow's forecast: likely Green if you sleep by 10pm."

### C. Flare Prediction Engine

**Prediction Window:** 4-48 hours in advance

**Pattern Recognition Inputs:**
- Rolling symptom averages
- Sleep drift detection
- Histamine load accumulation
- Autonomic instability indicators
- Stress-load accumulation
- Food tolerance patterns
- Previous-day exertion

**Example Outputs:**

*Standard flare prediction:*
> "Probability of flare today: 65%"
> "Likely cause: dehydration + sleep drift"
> "Recommended action: drink electrolytes + schedule light tasks only"

*MCAS-specific prediction:*
> "Histamine flare risk: 70% within 24 hours. You've had high-histamine foods 3 days running, pollen is elevated, and your belching increased yesterday. Consider a bland dinner and extra ketotifen tonight."

*POTS crash prediction:*
> "POTS crash risk: 55% by afternoon. You slept poorly, skipped morning electrolytes, and have a standing meeting at 2pm. Suggestion: front-load your salt intake and request a seated option for that meeting."

*Multi-system flare warning:*
> "Compound flare risk detected. Your MCAS markers, POTS indicators, and EDS joint instability are all trending up simultaneously. This pattern preceded your last major crash by 18 hours. Strong recommendation: cancel non-essential commitments today."

*Low-risk confirmation:*
> "Flare risk today: 15%. Sleep was solid, hydration is on track, no environmental triggers detected. This is a good day to tackle something from your 'Green days only' list."

*Post-exertion prediction:*
> "You pushed hard yesterday — 4 hours of cognitive work plus a social event. Based on your patterns, there's a 60% chance of a delayed crash tomorrow. Consider keeping tomorrow light as a buffer day."

### D. Intervention Recommendation System

**Intervention Categories:**
- Hydration protocols (electrolyte timing, volume)
- Vagal reset techniques (breathing, cold exposure, humming)
- Micro-movement sequences
- Rest positioning (horizontal recovery)
- Safe food recommendations
- Environmental adjustments (lighting, temperature, noise)
- Pacing strategy modifications
- Sleep correction protocols

**Intervention Characteristics:**
- Evidence-ranked but personalized over time
- Learns which interventions work for this specific user
- Never prescriptive or shaming
- Framed as experiments, not requirements

**Example Recommendations:**

*Hydration intervention:*
> "Your POTS markers are elevated. Here's a hydration protocol: 16oz water with 1/4 tsp salt now, another 8oz in 30 minutes. This has helped 4 of the last 5 times you were in this state."

*Vagal reset suggestion:*
> "You seem activated — heart rate up, short responses in your check-in. Want to try a 90-second vagal reset? Option A: cold water on wrists + slow exhale. Option B: hum for 6 breaths. Option C: skip it."

*Safe food recommendation:*
> "You're asking what to eat tonight. Based on your current histamine load, here are your safest options: chicken + rice, plain oatmeal, or that frozen soup you logged as 'always safe.' Avoid the leftover curry — it's been in the fridge 3 days."

*Micro-movement sequence:*
> "You've been stationary for 2 hours. Here's a 2-minute reclined sequence that won't spike your heart rate: ankle circles (30 sec), toe scrunches (30 sec), gentle knee-to-chest (60 sec). Do it lying down."

*Environmental adjustment:*
> "Your sensory load is climbing — you've been in bright light with background noise for 4 hours. Suggestion: dim lights to 50%, noise-canceling headphones, or relocate to the quiet room for 20 minutes."

*Sleep correction protocol:*
> "You've gone to bed after midnight 3 nights running. Tonight's correction: start wind-down at 9:30, dim all screens, take magnesium by 10pm. Want me to send a reminder at 9:30?"

*Personalized learning feedback:*
> "You tried the cold shower intervention yesterday when your budget was Red. Result: you reported feeling worse afterward. I'm marking cold exposure as 'not helpful during Red states' for you. We can revisit if you want."

### E. Task Management & EF Prosthesis

**Task Triage System:**
- Automatic priority scoring
- Energy cost classification (reclined/low/normal)
- Effort time estimation
- Context tagging (where, with whom, tools needed)

**Daily Structure:**
- "One Big Thing" (30-60 min, highest leverage)
- "Two Smalls" (≤15 min each)
- "If Time" micro-tasks
- Built-in recovery blocks

**Decision Support:**
- Decision trees for common choices
- Micro-checklists that break paralysis
- "Next best action" surfacing based on current state

**Example Interactions:**

*Daily structure presentation:*
> "Here's today's shape: **One Big Thing** — finish the budget review (45 min, requires focus, upright). **Two Smalls** — text mom back, refill water bottle. **If Time** — clear 3 emails. Recovery block suggested at 2pm."

*Energy-cost classification in action:*
> "You have 12 tasks in your backlog. Sorted by your current Yellow state: 4 are doable now (all low-energy, reclined-friendly), 5 need Green state, 3 are waiting on others. Want to see the 4 you can do now?"

*Automatic priority scoring:*
> "New task captured: 'Schedule dentist appointment.' Auto-scored: P2 (important, not urgent), 10-minute effort, low energy cost, requires phone + calendar. Filed under 'Yellow-state admin tasks.'"

*Decision tree for common choice:*
> "You're stuck on what to do next. Decision tree: Are you upright or reclined? → Reclined. Do you have your phone? → Yes. Can you handle human interaction? → No. Suggested task: Review saved articles (solo, reclined, no interaction)."

*Micro-checklist breaking paralysis:*
> "The 'clean kitchen' task has been stuck for 3 days. Here's a micro-checklist to break it down: ☐ Put 5 dishes in dishwasher. That's it. Just 5. Let me know when done and I'll give you the next step if you want it."

*Next best action surfacing:*
> "It's 3pm, you're Yellow, and you have 30 minutes before your call. Next best action: reply to Alex's email (12 min, low stakes, already drafted). Or: take a rest before the call. Which feels right?"

*Context-aware rescheduling:*
> "You marked the project proposal as today's One Big Thing, but you've been Red all morning. I've moved it to tomorrow's One Big Thing and swapped in 'organize receipts' (reclined-friendly) for today. Does that work?"

### F. Capture & Triage Pipeline

**Zero-Friction Capture:**
- Voice dictation → Notion inbox (1 tap)
- Text/message forwarding
- Web clipper integration
- Email forwarding

**AI Triage:**
- Auto-classification (Idea/Task/Reminder/Link/Note/Log)
- Urgency scoring (0-10)
- Effort estimation (5/15/30/60/120 min)
- Priority assignment (P0/P1/P2/P3)
- Next action generation

**Processing Workflow:**
- Do (next physical action)
- Delegate (to automation or human)
- Decide (needs attention, but later)
- Dream (long-term vision storage)

**Example Interactions:**

*Voice capture processing:*
> You said: "Remember to call the insurance company about that claim, also I had a really good idea about the garden project, and my energy is like a 4 right now"
>
> Parsed into: **Task** — Call insurance re: claim (P2, 15 min, phone required). **Idea** — Garden project note (filed to Dream). **Log** — Energy level 4 recorded at 2:15pm.

*Auto-classification feedback:*
> "3 new items in your inbox from this morning. Auto-sorted: 1 task (schedule car service), 1 link (article you saved), 1 reminder (Sarah's birthday next week). All look correct? Tap to adjust any."

*Daily digest of captured items:*
> "Today you captured 7 items. Breakdown: 3 tasks (all P2, totaling ~45 min), 2 ideas (filed), 1 symptom log, 1 random note. The 3 tasks are ready in your Yellow queue when you want them."

*Urgency scoring in action:*
> "New capture: 'Prescription runs out Friday.' Auto-scored urgency 8/10 (time-sensitive), P1 priority, 10-minute effort. Moved to top of tomorrow's queue. Does Friday work, or do you need it sooner?"

*Next action generation:*
> "You captured: 'Figure out tax situation.' That's vague, so I generated a next action: 'Find last year's tax return PDF.' 5 minutes, can be done reclined. Want me to file it that way?"

*Processing workflow suggestion:*
> "Your inbox has 12 unprocessed items. Quick triage: 4 are 'Do' (actionable tasks), 2 are 'Delegate' (things to ask others), 3 are 'Decide' (need more thought), 3 are 'Dream' (someday/maybe ideas). Want to batch-approve these categories?"

### G. Prediction Calibration System

**Purpose:** Train hyperlexic pattern recognition without burnout

**Tracking:**
- Prediction statements with probabilities
- Base rate comparisons
- Outcome resolution
- Brier and log scoring
- Bucket calibration analysis

**Feedback Loop:**
- Weekly calibration reports
- Over/underconfidence identification
- Accuracy improvement over time

**Burnout Guard:**
- Maximum open prediction cap
- Low-stakes vs. high-stakes filtering
- Automatic retirement of stale predictions

**Example Outputs:**

*Prediction logging prompt:*
> "You mentioned you think tomorrow will be a good day. Want to log that as a prediction? Suggested format: 'Tomorrow will be a Green day' — what probability? [50%] [60%] [70%] [80%]"

*Weekly calibration report:*
> "This week's calibration: You made 8 predictions. Your Brier score improved from 0.28 to 0.22. You're well-calibrated in the 60-80% range but overconfident at 90%+ (you said 90%, reality was closer to 70%). Consider reserving 90% for near-certainties."

*Bucket calibration feedback:*
> "Calibration check: Things you rate 70% likely actually happen 72% of the time — excellent. But things you rate 50% likely happen only 35% of the time. You might be underconfident in your uncertain predictions."

*Base rate comparison:*
> "You predicted 60% chance of a flare today. For context, your base rate for flares on days with similar conditions is 45%. Your prediction is a bit higher than historical — is there something specific making today different?"

*Burnout guard in action:*
> "You have 15 open predictions right now, which is at your cap. Before adding more, let's resolve some: Did the package arrive? Did you finish the project? Did the meeting go well? Quick yes/no for each."

*Accuracy trend feedback:*
> "Over the past month, your prediction accuracy improved 12%. You're getting better at estimating your own energy levels (was 60% accurate, now 78%). Flare predictions are still tricky (55% accurate) — that's normal, bodies are complex."

*Stale prediction retirement:*
> "These 3 predictions are over 2 weeks old and unresolved: 'Will hear back from recruiter,' 'Dentist will find cavities,' 'Rain this weekend.' Mark them as happened/didn't happen, or retire them as unresolvable?"

### H. Jarvis Journal System

**Purpose:** An AI-generated personal journal that synthesizes all tracked data into meaningful narrative reflections, helping the user understand their patterns, celebrate progress, and build self-knowledge over time.

- Optionally shareable (medical summary format)

**Example Outputs:**

*Daily Log entry:*
> **Friday, December 6**
>
> Today started Yellow — you slept 5.5 hours after a late night, and your HRV was below baseline. Despite that, you completed your One Big Thing (the budget review) and both Smalls. Impressive.
>
> Around 2pm, you logged belching and dropped to Red. You took a horizontal rest and had electrolytes, which brought you back to Yellow by 4pm. This matches your pattern of afternoon crashes after short sleep.
>
> Interventions tried: electrolytes (helped), horizontal rest (helped). No flare materialized, though one was predicted at 55% probability.
>
> Tomorrow looks better — you're planning an early night, and there are no environmental triggers forecasted. Suggested focus: one medium task and extra rest buffer.

*Weekly Review excerpt:*
> **Week of December 1-7**
>
> This was a 2-Green, 4-Yellow, 1-Red week — slightly better than last week's 1-4-2 distribution. Your average energy was 5.4/10, up from 4.9.
>
> The standout win: you completed the project proposal on Tuesday despite starting the day Yellow. You used the "micro-checklist" approach to break through paralysis, and it worked. Worth noting for future stuck moments.
>
> Thursday's Red day traced back to a combination: poor sleep Wednesday + high-histamine lunch + skipped morning electrolytes. Classic compound trigger. No single factor was the cause.
>
> Your predictions were 70% accurate this week (7/10). You're still slightly overconfident in the 80-90% range.
>
> One pattern emerged: your best days all included morning movement before 9am. It's now appeared in 8 of your last 10 Green days. Consider making it a default.

*Monthly Synthesis excerpt:*
> **November 2024 Synthesis**
>
> November was your best month since tracking began. You logged 8 Green days (up from 4 in October), and major flares dropped from 3 to 1.
>
> What changed? Three things stand out:
> 1. You hit your electrolyte target 85% of days (vs. 60% in October)
> 2. You started the sleep correction protocol mid-month
> 3. You cut out aged cheese entirely after the Research Brain flagged it
>
> Your most effective intervention this month was the 90-second vagal reset — you used it 12 times, and it improved your state 10 of those times. Least effective: the cold shower experiment (0 for 3).
>
> The one flare (November 18) followed a stressful family interaction + travel day. Multi-system compound, as usual.
>
> Looking ahead: December has holiday gatherings, which historically spike your social load. Consider pre-scheduling recovery days after events.

*Quarterly Deep Dive excerpt:*
> **Q4 2024 (October - December)**
>
> This quarter marked a turning point. When October began, you were averaging 2 major flares per month and struggling to complete basic tasks. By December's end, flares dropped to 1 per month and your task completion rate doubled.
>
> The biggest factor? Consistency. Your electrolyte compliance went from 45% to 88%. Sleep regularity improved by 40 minutes average. These aren't dramatic interventions — they're accumulated stability.
>
> Jarvis's flare predictions reached 72% accuracy by December, up from 58% in October. The system is learning your patterns.
>
> Seasonally, you handle early winter better than late fall — possibly related to stabilizing indoor routines. Worth watching in Q1.
>
> Goal check: You wanted to "feel functional most days." In December, you logged "functional" (Green or stable Yellow) on 24 of 31 days. That's 77%. You're close.

*Yearly Reflection excerpt:*
> **2024: The Year You Stopped Surviving and Started Stabilizing**
>
> A year ago, you started tracking because life felt impossible. Flares were unpredictable. Tasks piled up. Every day was a gamble.
>
> Twelve months later, the data tells a different story:
> - Major flares: 36 (Jan-Jun) → 9 (Jul-Dec)
> - Average energy: 3.8/10 (Q1) → 5.6/10 (Q4)
> - Green days per month: 2-3 (early year) → 8-10 (late year)
>
> What made the difference wasn't one thing — it was the compound effect of hundreds of small consistent choices, tracked and reinforced.
>
> Your biggest discovery: you're not fragile, you're reactive. And reactiveness can be predicted and managed. That reframe changed everything.
>
> If past-you could see current-you, they'd notice: you trust your body more. You've stopped fighting it and started collaborating with it.
>
> For 2025: You've stabilized the foundation. Now there's room to build.

## User Experience Principles

### For the AUDHD Brain

1. **Maximum 2 steps to capture anything**
   - If it takes more than 2 steps, it won't happen

2. **Single scrollable card, not scattered dashboards**
   - One place to see today's plan and state

3. **Interruption with consent**
   - "Can I borrow your focus for 2 min?" not sudden alerts

4. **Hyperfocus protection**
   - Gentle check-out nudges for extended single-task sessions

### For POTS/MCAS/EDS

1. **Energy-appropriate task surfacing**
   - Only show tasks matching current body bandwidth
   - "Reclined-friendly" task category

2. **Pattern recognition for symptoms**
   - "On POTS flare days, you complete more writing if you do it reclined between 2-5pm"

3. **Meal and supplement timing**
   - Curiosity-framed, not demanding
   - "Want to try X combo today and log?"

### For CPTSD/Trauma

1. **Absolutely zero shaming language**
   - Compassionate mirroring always

2. **Graceful absence handling**
   - If ghosted for 3 days: "Welcome back, let's pick the easiest win today"

3. **Overwhelm escape hatches**
   - One-tap "Valkyrie Switch" reset protocol
   - Physiological sigh + posture + grounding

### Visual Design Requirements

- Minimal, clean layouts
- Soft color palette (no harsh reds except critical alerts)
- Low text density
- Large touch targets
- Optional dark mode
- Predictable navigation patterns
- Font sizes comfortable during low-capacity states

---

## Operational Loops

### Daily Rhythm

**Morning (08:00):**
- Energy/mood/flag check-in (2 minutes)
- One Big Thing + Two Smalls selection
- Body bandwidth assessment
- Today's predicted flare risk

**Midday (13:00):**
- Quick progress check
- Energy recalibration
- Task-to-state matching update

**Evening (21:30):**
- Day reflection (what worked, what felt sticky)
- Wind-down protocol initiation
- Tomorrow's energy forecast

### Weekly Integration

**Sunday:**
- Weekly insight generation
- Pattern summary
- Calibration report
- Purpose/joy alignment check
- One micro-joy goal for next week

### Monthly Review

- Trend analysis across 30 days
- Intervention effectiveness ranking
- Experiment results summary
- System adjustment recommendations

---

## The Happiness Operating Model

Beyond productivity, Jarvis optimizes for sustainable wellbeing using the formula:

```
Happiness ≈ (Curiosity × Integrity × Autonomy × Connection × Regulation)
```

**Curiosity:** Steady diet of puzzles worth solving
**Integrity:** Actions aligned with ethics
**Autonomy:** Freedom that produces results
**Connection:** Resonant relationships with people who "get it"
**Regulation:** Nervous system safety as the foundation

If any term goes to zero, the whole equation collapses.
