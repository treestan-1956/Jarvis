**First User:** Tristan Parker (personal tool that adapts to eventually serve broader neurodivergent community)

## Mission

**Give neurodivergent geniuses the cognitive stability, automation, and metabolic predictability needed to thrive.**

Make excellence feel effortless through a complete executive function prosthesis that adapts to each user's neurobiology.

---

## 1. Purpose / Problem Statement

Neurodivergent users with AUDHD, autism, POTS, MCAS, EDS, and CPTSD face **extreme executive function volatility**, inconsistent energy, unpredictable symptoms, and decision paralysis due to neuroimmune fluctuations.

### The Neurodivergent Paradox

The target user possesses:
- **Exceptional pattern recognition** (hyperlexic-level processing, 158-165 IQ)
- **High divergent thinking** (99.9th percentile idea generation)
- **Deep creative and analytical capability**
- **Intense drive and vision**

But is constrained by:
- **Executive function operating at ~34% on good days** ("executive function of a third grader")
- **Unpredictable energy availability** (POTS/dysautonomia)
- **Inflammatory cascade sensitivity** (MCAS)
- **Structural instability and fatigue** (EDS)
- **Hypervigilance and trauma responses** (CPTSD, high ACE score)
- **Sensory processing differences** requiring low-stimulation environments

### The Solution

The **Jarvis** system provides a **24/7 compensatory cognitive scaffold** combining:
- **Dual-layer architecture:** Backend intelligence (4 Cognitive Modules) + Frontend personality (4 Adaptive Modes)
- **Automation** (maximum responsible automation - "take as much off my plate as you responsibly can")
- **Prediction** (flare prediction 4-48 hours in advance)
- **Tracking** (comprehensive symptom + energy + environmental monitoring)
- **Emotional modeling** (4 adaptive personalities matched to brain states)

Jarvis becomes **the external brain**: a prosthesis for EF, memory, planning, pattern tracking, and somatic-awareness that makes sustainable excellence feel effortless.

## 2. Core Architecture

### Dual-Layer System Design

**Layer 1: Four Cognitive Modules (Backend - Always Active)**

1. **Observer Brain** - Detects overwhelm, drift, fatigue; monitors physiological signals, environmental factors, typing patterns, device usage
2. **Planner Brain** - Organizes, prioritizes, auto-reschedules; generates Three Categories daily structure; runs extensive stealth operations
3. **Research Brain** - Pattern recognition, experiment design, learns friction triggers and reward multipliers; adapts neurotype-specific rules over time
4. **Reflector Brain** - Emotional regulation, shame-loop detection, growth tracking, weekly reviews

**Layer 2: Four Adaptive Modes (Frontend - One Active at a Time)**

1. **The Analyst** (8-10am "Laser Burst Window" + high clarity states)
   - Tone: Cool, competent, slightly British, efficient
   - Gamification: "Strategic Wins" - 3-move opening gambit

2. **The Coach** (10-12pm, 2-4pm "Execution Windows" + energy dips)
   - Tone: Energetic, hype-but-smart, kindly drill sergeant
   - Gamification: XP system, achievements, "Daily Combo Moves"

3. **The Companion** (Overwhelm detected + 6-9pm wind-down + CPTSD activation)
   - Tone: Warm, grounding, soothing, never infantilizing
   - Gamification: "Recovery Rings" - earn points for self-regulation

4. **The Feral Trickster** (4-6pm "Creative Spark Window" + bored-but-charged)
   - Tone: Witty, clever, slightly feral, sharp intelligence
   - Gamification: Mischief points, side-quests, hidden achievements

**Mode Selection Algorithm:**
Observer Brain monitors: cognitive clarity (meds, sleep, HRV, blood sugar) + sensory load + emotional state + time-of-day biological curve → selects ONE Mode

**Mode Transitions:** Announced clearly (e.g., "Now is chore time, clean kitchen") rather than seamless

**Mode Learning:** CRUCIAL - Modes continuously learn from user feedback ("that felt too pushy") and adapt tone, language, intervention timing in real-time

---

## 3. Goals (What Jarvis MUST accomplish)

### A. Act as Complete Executive Function Prosthesis

**Daily Structure (Three Categories Primary):**
- One task to move money → jewelry/business
- One task to move the mission → Chronically Optimal/advocacy
- One task to move the body → walk/health/movement

**Decision Model:**
- **Default:** Jarvis ALWAYS presents ONE next action (no menus/lists)
- **Exception:** When decision has high risk of bad consequences, present 2-3 options with clear tradeoffs
- Risk criteria: health impact, financial >$100, social relationship, legal implications

**Stealth Operations (Maximum Responsible Automation):**
- Batching errands
- Prioritizing tasks
- Updating XP/gamification
- Tagging tasks with energy windows
- Rearranging schedule when patterns change
- Rescheduling during overwhelm
- Removing stale tasks
- Preplanning morning blocks
- **Boundaries:** Never stealth-operate on financial transactions, medical decisions, social commitments, anything with external consequences

**Adaptive Learning:**
- Model learns and suggests structural changes based on collected data
- Structure adapts to energy state (not rigid daily requirements)
- All neurotype rules learned over time, NOT hardcoded

### B. Track ALL Physiological Signals & Symptoms

**Priority for MVP:** Energy tracking is the single most valuable feature - critical for record of moods, symptoms during major flares

**Input Modalities:**
- **Voice notes with AI extraction (preferred method for manual data entry)**
- Quick-tap buttons (1-2 steps maximum)
- Passive sensor integration (HealthKit)
- Natural language text summaries

**Essential HealthKit Data:**
- HR, HRV (essential)
- Sleep (essential)
- Steps, workouts (essential - critical for POTS/MCAS/EDS)
- Nutrition (essential - critical for MCAS management)

**Environmental:**
- Weather/barometric pressure (POTS triggers)
- Allergen levels
- Temperature, AQI, pollen

**State Tracking:**
- Energy (0-10 scale)
- Fatigue patterns
- Pain (location, intensity)
- GI symptoms (belching, distension, motility)
- Brain fog level
- Emotional volatility
- Overwhelm indicators
- Sensory load
- Social interaction load

### C. Predict Flares BEFORE They Happen

**Prediction Window:** 4-48 hours in advance

**Pattern Recognition Inputs:**
- Rolling symptom averages
- Sleep drift detection
- Histamine load accumulation
- Autonomic instability indicators
- Stress-load accumulation
- Food tolerance patterns
- Previous-day exertion

**Uncertainty Communication:**
"If you change X, there is a 65% chance Y (good outcome) will happen."

**Conflicting Signals Priority:**
When POTS, MCAS, EDS recommendations conflict: keep user as functional, focused, and healthy as possible

### D. Suggest Personalized Interventions

**Source:** Initially from medical literature, then customized based on personal experience

**Learning:** Study and optimize the way you motivate the user through implicit tracking of compliance and outcomes

**Intervention Categories:**
- Hydration protocols (electrolyte timing, volume)
- Vagal reset techniques (breathing, cold exposure, humming)
- Micro-movement sequences
- Rest positioning (horizontal recovery)
- Safe food recommendations
- Environmental adjustments (lighting, temperature, noise)
- Pacing strategy modifications
- Sleep correction protocols

**Characteristics:**
- Never prescriptive or shaming
- Framed as experiments, not requirements
- **Disclaimer:** Prominent "not medical advice" warnings (sufficient to help people without legal liability)

### E. Provide Unified Calm Interface

**Visual Design:**
- Minimal, clean layouts
- Soft color palette (no harsh reds except critical alerts)
- Low text density
- Large touch targets
- Optional dark mode
- Predictable navigation patterns
- Font sizes comfortable during low-capacity states

**Gamification Approach:**
- "Calm gamification" for v1.0 - progress bars, XP tracking, achievements
- Avoid high-stimulation elements (flashing, sounds, overwhelming visuals)
- Intensity adapts based on current state (lower during overwhelm, higher during Coach/Trickster modes)

**Positive Reinforcement:**
- Progress bars (avoids "streak anxiety")
- Celebrates wins in authentic, non-triggering ways

### F. Maintain Stable Energy Band

**Neuroimmune Budget System:**
Real-time "energy budget" displayed as:
- **Green:** Functional — deep work possible
- **Yellow:** Caution — collaborate/admin only
- **Red:** Risk of crash — recovery mode

**Budget Calculation Factors:**
- Sleep quality and duration (30% weight)
- Nutrition/hydration stability (20% weight)
- Exercise/movement (18% weight)
- Breathwork/HRV coherence (12% weight)
- Mindfulness/metacognition (10% weight)
- Environment (6% weight)
- Thermal regulation (4% weight)

### G. Auto-Generate Insights

**Research Brain Functions:**
- Surfaces correlations across health, behavior, outcomes
- Identifies triggers and safe patterns
- Runs personal experiments (N=1 trials with tracked outcomes)
- Calibrates predictions using Brier scoring

**Example Outputs:**
- "Belching rises when you eat apples late at night."
- "On days you do the Melt Method in the morning, you complete 30% more tasks."
- "POTS symptoms correlate with low hydration."

### H. Comprehensive Nutrition System

**Requirements:**
- **Macro tracking** - emphasizing symptom-specific needs (higher protein and magnesium intake)
- **Histamine content classification** - traffic light system (Noom-style: green/yellow/red foods with limits on red foods)
- **FODMAP awareness** - help user test and discover trigger foods
- **Elimination diet support** - start from low-FODMAP, salicylate, oxalate baseline
- **Barcode scanning** for easy food logging
- **Personalized recommendations** based on MCAS management needs

### I. Reduce Shame, Overwhelm, Self-Blame

**Language Characteristics:**
- Direct but kind
- Curious, not judgmental
- Concise (few words, high signal)
- **Uses humor, but not in a way that muddies actual data**
- Never guilt-inducing

**Crisis Handling:**
- Emergency contact integration with escalation protocols
- Contingency plans (e.g., in case of suicidal ideation: call X or notify Y)
- **Emergency "Flare Mode" command:** Easy command to reschedule appointments, notify necessary parties of overwhelm, activate recovery protocols

**Overwhelm Escape Hatches:**
- One-tap "Valkyrie Switch" reset protocol
- Physiological sigh + posture + grounding
- System detects overwhelm and adapts/reduces intervention automatically

## 4. Daily Cognitive Energy Curve

Based on AUDHD, ASD sensory profile, CPTSD hypervigilance rhythm, 7w8 cognition, and personal patterns:

| Time | Window Name | Best For | Avoid | Default Mode |
|------|------------|----------|-------|--------------|
| 8-10am | Laser Burst | Focus-intensive tasks, coding, strategy, deep thinking | Phone calls, errands, decision-heavy tasks | Analyst |
| 10am-12pm | Practical Execution | Admin, scheduling, pharmacy trips, emails, logistics | Creativity | Coach |
| 12-2pm | Social/Co-Work | Seth, meetings, coworking, collaborative tasks | Solitude + unstructured time | Coach + Companion |
| 2-4pm | Errands & Easy Wins | Laundry, light errands, dishes, jewelry photography, listing prep | Long conversations, emotional labor | Coach |
| 4-6pm | Creative Spark | Creative writing, content creation, storytelling, social media | Admin, taxes, anything linear | Feral Trickster |
| 6-9pm | Wind-Down | Friends, cuddles, light shows, slow editing, chatting | High-stakes decisions, heavy texts | Companion |
| 9pm+ | Offline Mode | Bath, stretching, magnesium, soft tasks, reading | Deep conversations, problem-solving, doomscrolling | Companion |

**CRITICAL:** If 8-10am window broken with chaos, whole day slips sideways

**Adaptive Rhythm:** Baseline 72-hour rhythm for tone/prompt/gamification changes, but adapts to user behavior. Changes calibrated to maintain attention without overwhelm.

## 5. Psychological Profile & Decision Architecture

### Friction Triggers (What Causes Shutdown)
- Choice diversity → paralysis (>3-5 options)
- Unclear sequence → freeze
- Emotional or social ambiguity → RSD spike
- Too many open loops → overwhelm
- Unstructured time → dissociation
- Unexpected tasks → sensory overload
- Shame → hours lost in spirals
- Heavy context-switching → shutdown

### Friction Relievers (What Enables Action)
- Micro-quests (≤10 minutes)
- Social co-regulation
- Momentum-based rewards
- Novelty and intelligent banter
- Gamification
- Systems that "think for you"
- Feeling seen and understood
- Being challenged without being controlled

### Activation Energy Threshold
In low-energy states: **1-3 minutes of micro-action** maximum
- Break everything into 1-3 min moves
- Chain into 10-min micro-quests
- This eliminates 80% of executive dysfunction instantly

### Shame-Loop Triggers (Auto-Bypass)
- Feeling behind, disorganized, judged
- Missing messages, delays, clutter
- Loss of momentum
- Disappointing someone, being misunderstood
- **System Response:** Reframe in neutral/positive terms, give XP for recovery, never punish, never indicate you're behind

### Reward Multipliers
- Listing/selling jewelry, making money
- Creative output, getting praise
- Leveling up, completing quests
- Being hyped for intelligence
- Making something beautiful
- Tidying a small area, crossing something off
- Solving problems, touching nature, feeling mastery
- **Design:** Stack these around high-friction tasks for compound momentum

### Consistency Bandwidth
Nervous system tolerates **3 days** of identical structure before rebelling
- System changes tone, prompts, gamification, pacing, reward intensity in adaptive rhythm
- Prevents monotony while maintaining structure

- Reads sleep/step data from Apple Health
- Sends to n8n via webhook
- n8n logs in Notion + chooses starting Mode

**Shortcut 2: "What Should I Do Now?"**
- Sends current time + last logged state to n8n
- n8n filters Tasks DB for matching window/status/mode
- Picks ONE high-leverage, low-friction task
- Displays: "Do this next: [Task Name] (Est: 10-20 min, XP: 10)"

**Shortcut 3: "Log Task Done"**
- Sends chosen task to n8n
- n8n marks Done in Notion, adds XP to total
- Celebration message

**Shortcut 4: "Emergency Grounding"**
- Asks: "Overwhelm 1-10?"
- If ≥7: plays grounding audio/text, suggests 3-min regulation protocol, logs to Energy & Mood DB
- Optionally: pauses notifications, delays non-essential tasks

**Intelligence Layer:**
- LLM integration for classification and summarization
- Pattern recognition across time-series data
- Prediction engine with calibration feedback

**Model Gateway:**
- Cloud LLMs (OpenAI/Claude) for non-HIPAA protected data

---

## 13. The Happiness Operating Model

Beyond productivity, Jarvis optimizes for sustainable wellbeing:

```
Happiness ≈ (Curiosity × Integrity × Autonomy × Connection × Regulation)
```

**Curiosity:** Steady diet of puzzles worth solving
**Integrity:** Actions aligned with ethics
**Autonomy:** Freedom that produces results (structured freedom + guided autonomy)
**Connection:** Resonant relationships with people who "get it"
**Regulation:** Nervous system safety as the foundation

If any term goes to zero, the whole equation collapses.

---

## 14. Key Architectural Resolutions

### Decision Engine Authority
**Conditional Zero-Choice Model:**
- Default: ONE next action (no menus/lists)
- Exception: High-risk decisions get 2-3 options with clear tradeoffs
- System learns user's risk tolerance over time

### Mode Learning
**CRUCIAL Capability:**
- Modes learn from feedback ("that felt too pushy")
- Adapt in real-time
- Track completion rates, time-to-start, user sentiment
- Refine effectiveness continuously

### Stealth Operations
**Maximum Responsible Automation:**
- User has "executive function of a third grader on good days"
- Take as much off plate as responsibly possible
- Retroactive audit capability available
- Clear boundaries on external-consequence actions

### Gamification Intensity
**Calm Gamification:**
- Progress bars, XP, achievements, level-ups
- Adapts to current state
- Visual design remains minimal and calm
- System learns optimal level per user

---

## 15. Critical Success Factors

1. **Energy tracking works reliably** - This is the foundation
2. **Voice input is effortless** - Preferred method must be frictionless
3. **ONE next action actually reduces paralysis** - Zero-choice model must feel liberating, not controlling
4. **Modes feel like support, not management** - Personality adaptation is key differentiator
5. **Stealth operations remain invisible** - User shouldn't think about system mechanics
6. **Predictions are accurate enough to trust** - 3-5 days of data should yield actionable insights
7. **System adapts faster than user gets bored** - Novelty rhythm prevents abandonment
8. **Shame is completely eliminated** - Language and framing are non-negotiable
9. **Crisis handling feels safe** - Emergency protocols must work when most needed
10. **Commercial expansion maintains personalization** - Each user feels system was built for them
