# PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS DOCUMENT (PRD): JARVIS — Neurodivergent Executive Function Prosthesis

**Version:** 1.0
**Owner:** Tristan Parker
**Product Type:** AI-augmented personal OS
**Target User:** AUDHD, autistic, POTS/MCAS/EDS, CPTSD, gifted-intelligent, sensory-sensitive individuals

## Mission

**Give neurodivergent geniuses the cognitive stability, automation, and metabolic predictability needed to thrive.**

---

## 1. Purpose / Problem Statement

Neurodivergent users with AUDHD, autism, POTS, MCAS, EDS, and CPTSD face **extreme executive function volatility**, inconsistent energy, unpredictable symptoms, and decision paralysis due to neuroimmune fluctuations.

The user possesses exceptional intelligence, creativity, and insight but is limited by:

- inconsistent energy availability
- disrupted autonomic function (POTS)
- MCAS-related inflammation
- EDS-related instability and fatigue
- sensory overwhelm
- trauma-system hypervigilance
- unpredictability in daily capacities

The **Jarvis** system provides a **24/7 compensatory cognitive scaffold**, combining automation, prediction, tracking, and emotional modeling to:

- regulate physiological load
- manage tasks
- track symptoms
- predict flares
- offer interventions
- reduce cognitive overhead
- help the user thrive sustainably

Jarvis becomes **the external brain**: a prosthesis for EF, memory, planning, pattern tracking, and somatic-awareness.

## 2. Goals (What Jarvis MUST accomplish)

Jarvis must:

### A. Act as a full Executive Function Prosthesis

- Organize tasks into energy/brain-state appropriate categories
- Prioritize automatically
- Push only the minimum necessary tasks
- Auto-reschedule when a flare is detected
- Provide decision support with minimal text

### B. Track ALL physiological signals & symptoms

- Energy
- Fatigue
- Pain
- Belching/distension
- GI motility
- Sleep
- Heart rate (from HealthKit)
- Hydration
- Electrolyte intake
- Environmental data (allergens, weather, barometric pressure)
- Sensory overwhelm
- Social load
- Emotional volatility
- "Neuroimmune budget"

### C. Predict flares BEFORE they happen

Jarvis uses pattern recognition to identify:

- histamine load
- autonomic instability
- sleep drift
- EF overload
- stress-load accumulation
- food intolerances
- early GI dysregulation
- early POTS dysregulation

Then issues alerts such as:

> "Your system is tilting red. Drink electrolytes + reduce cognitive load for 2 hours."

### D. Suggest personalized interventions

Jarvis must actively recommend:

- hydration
- rest
- safe foods
- micro-exercise
- breathing/vagal resets
- environmental adjustments
- pacing strategies
- sleep correction
- scheduling changes

### E. Provide a unified calm interface

Everything must be:

- visually simple
- clean
- no clutter
- few words
- low sensory load
- predictable
- soothing
- intuitive
- designed for AUDHD brains

### F. Keep the user in a stable energy band

Jarvis's mission is to **prevent crashes, overwhelm, and flares** by maintaining:

- stable blood volume
- stable histamine load
- steady sleep
- correct pacing
- minimized stress exposure
- predictable nutrition

### G. Auto-Generate insights

Jarvis acts like a lab partner:

- identifies correlations
- surfaces hidden patterns
- says what changed
- notifies the user when something is off
- summarizes the week in accessible language

Examples:

- "Belching rises when you eat apples late at night."
- "Sleep worsened when you pushed 2 hard days in a row."
- "POTS symptoms correlated with low hydration."

### H. Maintain a "low-friction life environment"

Jarvis should:

- automate recurring tasks
- reorder simple supplies
- maintain grocery lists
- track bills and deadlines
- predict the user's future energy

### I. Reduce shame, overwhelm, and self-blame

The system must:

- use nonjudgmental language
- respect capacity limits
- offer compassion + clarity
- avoid "shoulds"
- reinforce stability, not hustle

Jarvis should feel like:

**the combination of a warm, brilliant lab partner + a gentle guardian AI.**

## 3. Non-Goals (What Jarvis is NOT)

Jarvis is **NOT**:

### A punitive system

- No guilt
- No moral language
- No "you failed a streak"
- No overwhelming notifications

### A replacement for autonomy

Jarvis supports decisions but never overrides agency.

### A medical diagnostic tool

It tracks patterns but does not "diagnose."

### A rigid structure

Neurodivergent systems require adaptability.

### An app that requires perfection

It must work even in low-capacity states.

### A sensory-heavy system

- No clutter.
- No dopamine-sucking "gamification."
- No overwhelming UI.

### A surveillance system

Data is for empowerment, not pressure.

### Something that assumes a 9–5 life

Jarvis adapts to nonlinear energy rhythms.

## 4. Core Features & Requirements

### A. Symptom Tracking Engine

**Must track:**

- fatigue
- energy
- brain fog
- pain
- joint instability
- GI issues
- belching
- distension
- hydration
- electrolytes
- sleep patterns
- HRV
- sensory overload
- emotional state
- environmental triggers
- meds/supplements
- menstrual cycle (if relevant)

**Input modalities:**

- manual quick-taps
- passive sensors (Apple Health)
- text summaries
- voice notes
- AI extraction from unstructured data

### B. Neuroimmune Budget System

Jarvis must calculate a real-time "budget" based on:

- sleep
- hydration
- emotional load
- task complexity
- previous-day strain
- sensory input
- autonomic instability
- stress exposure

Displayed simply as:

- Green (functional)
- Yellow (caution)
- Red (risk of crash)

### C. Flare Prediction Engine

Predict flares 4–48 hours in advance using:

- pattern recognition
- rolling symptom averages
- environmental conditions
- task load
- sleep drift
- food logs
- heart rate patterns
- histamine load
- POTS precursors

**Output:**

- "Probability of flare today: 65%."
- "Cause: dehydration + sleep drift."
- "Action: drink electrolytes + schedule light tasks only."

### D. Autonomic Regulation Toolkit

Jarvis suggests:

- breathing protocols
- micro-exercise
- horizontal rest
- heat therapy
- hydration schedules
- pacing
- compression decisions (if needed)

- auto-prioritize tasks
- categorize by energy cost
- auto-reschedule
- "Today's capacity" suggestions
- a "minimum viable day" mode
- streaks WITHOUT shame
- decision trees
- micro-checklists
- chunking

Jarvis must reduce cognitive load, not add to it.

### F. Food Tracking + Safe Food Loop

**Tracks:**

- what you ate
- symptoms afterward
- identifies triggers
- identifies safe foods

**Jarvis creates:**

- flare-day menus
- low-histamine menus
- safe meals you can cook even on low-energy days
- auto-generated grocery lists

### G. Daily Recommendations Module

**Jarvis outputs:**

- Today's predicted energy
- hydration schedule
- safe foods

- environmental risk
- "Do these 3 things and the day will go well."

### H. Weekly Review + Insight Generation

Jarvis gives a low-text summary:

- what went well
- flare risks
- triggers detected
- improvements
- patterns

It should feel like receiving a data-driven letter from a brilliant friend.
