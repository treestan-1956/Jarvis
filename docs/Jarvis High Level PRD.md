# PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS DOCUMENT (PRD): JARVIS — Neurodivergent Executive Function Prosthesis

**Version:** 1.0
**Owner:** Tristan Parker
**Product Type:** AI-augmented personal OS
**Target User:** AUDHD, autistic, POTS/MCAS/EDS, CPTSD, gifted-intelligent, sensory-sensitive individuals

## Mission

**Give neurodivergent geniuses the cognitive stability, automation, and metabolic predictability needed to thrive.**

---

## 1. Purpose / Problem Statement

Neurodivergent users with AUDHD, autism, POTS, MCAS, EDS, and CPTSD face **extreme executive function volatility**, inconsistent energy, unpredictable symptoms, and decision paralysis due to neuroimmune fluctuations.

The user possesses exceptional intelligence, creativity, and insight but is limited by:

- inconsistent energy availability
- disrupted autonomic function (POTS)
- MCAS-related inflammation
- EDS-related instability and fatigue
- sensory overwhelm
- trauma-system hypervigilance
- unpredictability in daily capacities

The **Jarvis** system provides a **24/7 compensatory cognitive scaffold**, combining automation, prediction, tracking, and emotional modeling to:

- regulate physiological load
- manage tasks
- track symptoms
- predict flares
- offer interventions
- reduce cognitive overhead
- help the user thrive sustainably

Jarvis becomes **the external brain**: a prosthesis for EF, memory, planning, pattern tracking, and somatic-awareness.

---

## 2. Goals (What Jarvis MUST accomplish)

Jarvis must:

### A. Act as a full Executive Function Prosthesis

- Organize tasks into energy/brain-state appropriate categories
- Prioritize automatically
- Push only the minimum necessary tasks
- Auto-reschedule when a flare is detected
- Provide decision support with minimal text

### B. Track ALL physiological signals & symptoms

- Energy
- Fatigue
- Pain
- Belching/distension
- GI motility
- Sleep
- Heart rate (from HealthKit)
- Hydration
- Electrolyte intake
- Environmental data (allergens, weather, barometric pressure)
- Sensory overwhelm
- Social load
- Emotional volatility
- "Neuroimmune budget"

### C. Predict flares BEFORE they happen

Jarvis uses pattern recognition to identify:

- histamine load
- autonomic instability
- sleep drift
- EF overload
- stress-load accumulation
- food intolerances
- early GI dysregulation
- early POTS dysregulation

Then issues alerts such as:

> "Your system is tilting red. Drink electrolytes + reduce cognitive load for 2 hours."

### D. Suggest personalized interventions

Jarvis must actively recommend:

- hydration
- rest
- safe foods
- micro-exercise
- breathing/vagal resets
- environmental adjustments
- pacing strategies
- sleep correction
- scheduling changes

### E. Provide a unified calm interface

Everything must be:

- visually simple
- clean
- no clutter
- few words
- low sensory load
- predictable
- soothing
- intuitive
- designed for AUDHD brains

### F. Keep the user in a stable energy band

Jarvis's mission is to **prevent crashes, overwhelm, and flares** by maintaining:

- stable blood volume
- stable histamine load
- steady sleep
- correct pacing
- minimized stress exposure
- predictable nutrition

### G. Auto-Generate insights

Jarvis acts like a lab partner:

- identifies correlations
- surfaces hidden patterns
- says what changed
- notifies the user when something is off
- summarizes the week in accessible language

Examples:

- "Belching rises when you eat apples late at night."
- "Sleep worsened when you pushed 2 hard days in a row."
- "POTS symptoms correlated with low hydration."

### H. Maintain a "low-friction life environment"

Jarvis should:

- automate recurring tasks
- reorder simple supplies
- maintain grocery lists
- track bills and deadlines
- predict the user's future energy

### I. Reduce shame, overwhelm, and self-blame

The system must:

- use nonjudgmental language
- respect capacity limits
- offer compassion + clarity
- avoid "shoulds"
- reinforce stability, not hustle

Jarvis should feel like:

**the combination of a warm, brilliant lab partner + a gentle guardian AI.**

---

## 3. Non-Goals (What Jarvis is NOT)

Jarvis is **NOT**:

### A punitive system

- No guilt
- No moral language
- No "you failed a streak"
- No overwhelming notifications

### A replacement for autonomy

Jarvis supports decisions but never overrides agency.

### A medical diagnostic tool

It tracks patterns but does not "diagnose."

### A rigid structure

Neurodivergent systems require adaptability.

### An app that requires perfection

It must work even in low-capacity states.

### A sensory-heavy system

- No clutter.
- No dopamine-sucking "gamification."
- No overwhelming UI.

### A surveillance system

Data is for empowerment, not pressure.

### Something that assumes a 9–5 life

Jarvis adapts to nonlinear energy rhythms.

## 11. PRD Review: Clarification Questions

*The following questions were generated by a product owner review to bring this project into sharp focus before technical architecture or detailed design begins. Each question represents a decision point that, if left unresolved, could cause significant rework or misalignment later in development.*

---

### 11.1 Target User Clarity and Persona Details

**Primary User Definition**

- Is this product being built exclusively for the product owner (Tristan Parker) as a personal tool, or is there intent to serve a broader user base?
- If broader, what is the anticipated user population size and demographic profile?
- The target user description mentions "AUDHD, autistic, POTS/MCAS/EDS, CPTSD, gifted-intelligent, sensory-sensitive individuals" - is the expectation that users have ALL of these conditions, or ANY combination? This significantly impacts feature prioritization.

**Persona Specificity**

- What does a typical day look like for the target user currently (without Jarvis)?
- What are the top 3 "pain moments" that cause the most distress or dysfunction?
- What existing tools, apps, or coping mechanisms does the target user currently employ? What works and what fails?
- How does the user currently track symptoms (if at all)? Paper, apps, memory?
- What is the user's technical proficiency level? Comfortable with complex apps or needs extreme simplicity?

**Context of Use**

- When during the day would Jarvis primarily be used? Morning planning, throughout day, evening review?
- What devices does the user have access to? iPhone only? iPad? Apple Watch? Mac?
- Is the user employed, self-employed, disabled, or variable? This affects task management requirements significantly.
- Does the user live alone, with family, with caregivers? This affects notification and intervention design.

**Capacity Variability**

- On the worst days, what level of interaction is realistic? Can the user tap a button? Use voice? Look at a screen at all?
- What percentage of days are "worst days" vs. "functional days" vs. "good days"?
- Are there periods of extended dysfunction (days/weeks) that the system needs to accommodate gracefully?

---

### 11.2 Feature Prioritization and MVP Scope

**Critical MVP Definition**

- The PRD lists approximately 30+ distinct capabilities. Which 3-5 features would provide 80% of the value for v1.0?
- If you could only have ONE feature working perfectly, which would it be?
- What is the absolute minimum viable product that would be worth using daily?

**Feature Dependencies**

- The Flare Prediction Engine depends on extensive historical data. What is the minimum data collection period before predictions become meaningful?
- Can Task Triage work independently of symptom tracking, or are they interdependent in your vision?
- Does the Neuroimmune Budget system require all sensor integrations, or can it start with manual inputs?

**Phasing Strategy**

- What is the desired timeline for v1.0? Weeks, months, quarters?
- Are there specific life events, seasons, or circumstances driving urgency?
- Would you prefer a "thin slice" MVP (one feature done well) or a "broad shallow" MVP (many features at basic level)?

**Feature Validation**

- For each major feature, how will you know if it is actually helping vs. adding cognitive load?
- What is the rollback strategy if a feature causes harm (increased anxiety, decision paralysis)?
- How much experimentation tolerance exists? Can features be A/B tested?

---

### 11.3 Technical Feasibility and Constraints

**Flare Prediction Accuracy Requirements**

- The document claims prediction "4-48 hours in advance." What is the acceptable false positive rate? False negative rate?
- Would an 80% accurate prediction be acceptable, or does anything below 95% cause more harm than good?
- What happens when the system predicts a flare and the user cannot actually rest or reduce load?

**AI/ML Capabilities**

- What is the expected source of ML models? Custom-trained, pre-trained foundation models with fine-tuning, rule-based heuristics?
- For pattern recognition across symptoms, is supervised learning (requiring labeled training data) acceptable, or must the system learn unsupervised?
- What is the cold-start strategy? How does Jarvis provide value in week 1 before patterns emerge?

**Data Volume and Processing**

- Estimating ~20 tracked variables with multiple daily readings, plus integrations, the data model could grow to thousands of data points monthly. Is local-only storage truly viable long-term?
- What are the device storage constraints? Older iPhone models?
- How much battery drain is acceptable for background processing and sensor polling?

**Offline Functionality**

- Must all core features work completely offline?
- If AI features require cloud processing, what is the fallback behavior?
- How long should the system function without internet connectivity?

**Platform Constraints**

- Is this iOS-only, or is cross-platform (Android, web) in scope?
- Apple Watch support - required for v1.0 or stretch goal?
- Mac companion app - needed or out of scope?

---

### 11.4 Integration Dependencies and Requirements

- Should a trusted person be able to view status or receive alerts?
- Is there a "share with doctor" feature?
- Privacy boundaries with family members?

---

### 11.15 Top 10 Blocking Questions

If you can only answer 10 questions before proceeding, these are the most critical:

1. **Is this a personal tool or a product for others?** This fundamentally changes architecture, design, and sustainability decisions.

2. **What are the 3-5 MVP features?** The current scope is too broad for focused development.

3. **What is the acceptable flare prediction accuracy?** This determines whether ML is required or rule-based heuristics suffice.

4. **What is the cold-start experience?** How does Jarvis provide value in week 1?

5. **How will you measure success objectively?** Current metrics lack measurement methodology.

6. **What is the maximum acceptable cognitive load for using Jarvis?** This sets UX constraints.

7. **What happens on the worst days?** The system must accommodate zero-capacity states.

8. **What is the technology stack decision?** Native vs. cross-platform affects everything.

9. **Who builds and maintains this?** Resource constraints shape scope.

10. **What existing solutions have failed and why?** Understanding past failures prevents repeating them.
