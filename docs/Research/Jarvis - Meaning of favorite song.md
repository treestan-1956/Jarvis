**ChatGPT:**

Heard. You don’t want comfort—you want systems that run the boring/executive-function stuff for you. Here’s a tight, plug-and-play setup you can start today. If you want, I can also wire any of these as actual recurring reminders/automations for you.

# The “Let It Run Itself” Starter Pack

## 1) Supplies on rails

* **Water & basics subscription:** Auto-deliver (e.g., weekly/biweekly) water, TP, paper towels, trash bags.
    
    * Failsafe: a **Sunday stock check** reminder: “Tell me to check pantry + water. If under 3 gallons, place order.”
        
* **Auto-grocery template:** Pin a single list that never changes (milk, eggs, fruit, 3 frozen meals, broth, electrolyte packets). Re-order same cart each week.
    
* **Pre-packed “reset bins”:** One bin per room with wipes, trash liners, microfiber, small broom—no hunting for supplies.
    

## 2) Health & meds autopilot

* **Meds timers:** 1–3 fixed alarms (not “flexible”) + a nightly refill reminder.
    
* **Symptom snapshot:** 30-second daily check-in: energy (0–3), dizziness (0–3), pain (0–3). If any ≥2, auto-reduce tomorrow (see #5).
    
* **Ice-nap protocol automation:** A single routine that runs: “Mop Segment → 12-minute timer → ‘Lie down with ice’ → 15-minute timer → repeat x5.” (I can set reminders for the 5 cycles.)
    

## 3) Housekeeping as micro-loops

* **Kitchen in fifths:** Mon/Wed/Fri: “Do one-fifth of kitchen + run Mop Routine.”
    
* **Laundry cadence:** Tue = wash, Thu = dry/fold. Two fixed days beats “when I feel like it.”
    
* **Dish rule:** Run dishwasher at night, unload with morning tea—no decision needed.
    

## 4) Money: set-and-forget

* **Autopay everything** (rent, utilities, phone, internet).
    
* **First-of-month money sweep:** one reminder: “Open money dashboard, confirm autopays, scan for weirdness (5 min max).”
    

## 5) Energy-based day (three modes)

Make _one_ daily choice on wake:

* **Green day (energy 3):** 1 focus task + 1 admin + 1 body task.
    
* **Yellow (energy 2):** 1 focus _or_ 2 micro-tasks.
    
* **Red (energy 0–1):** Only maintenance: meds, food, water, shower, inbox 5. Everything else autodefers.  
    I can set a **7am “Pick your day color”** nudge and a matching to-do card.
    

## 6) Inbox & messages

* **Inbox-5 rule:** timer for 5 emails/DMs, twice a day. Stop at 5.
    
* **Triage cheat sheet:** Archive, Reply-later, 2-minute reply now. No fourth option.
    
* **Auto-response for low-energy days:** “I’m heads-down on health today; replies may be slow.”
    

## 7) Food without decisions

* **Three default meals** you rotate (e.g., oatmeal/eggs; soup & toast; freezer entrée + salad kit).
    
* **Sunday “same cart again”** reminder for groceries; swap only 1–2 items if you want novelty.
    

## 8) Calendar guardrails

* **Default travel time** auto-added to all events (prevents late-start chaos).
    
* **Buffer blocks:** 30 min before/after any appointment—non-negotiable.
    
* **Monthly medical admin hour**: schedule/renewals/referrals in one shot.
    

## 9) Environment that prompts action

* **Staging baskets** near bed, couch, door (keys, meds for the day, electrolytes, chargers).
    
* **One-touch hampers & bins** in every room: make the right action the easy action.
    

## 10) “Emergency brake” rules

* If two red-days in a row → **auto-message yourself:** cancel nonessential plans for 48h.
    
* If dizziness/pain ≥2 for 3 days → **auto-prompt:** book telehealth / adjust routine.
    

* * *

# Ready-to-drop automations (what I can set as reminders for you)

1. **Weekly pantry+water check** (Sun 5pm).
    
2. **Re-order groceries** (Sun 6pm): “Repeat last cart.”
    
3. **Meds alarms** (morning/evening) + nightly refill (9pm).
    
4. **Daily energy color pick** (7am).
    
5. **Kitchen fifths + Mop/Ice cycle** (Mon/Wed/Fri 2pm).
    
6. **Inbox-5** (11am & 4pm).
    
7. **Money sweep** (1st of month, 10am).
    
8. **Medical admin hour** (2nd Tue, 1pm).
    
9. **Travel buffers** (I’ll remind you to add them when new events appear).
    
10. **Red-day protocol** (evening check; if Red ×2, send cancellation script).
    

If you want, tell me which of these you want turned on and I’ll set them up now as scheduled reminders. If you’d rather keep it lightweight, I can start with just: **water+pantry check, grocery reorder, meds, and the daily energy pick**—the four that move the most needles with the least effort.

* * *

**You:**

Yes!!!

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

Boom — I’ve set up your core automations:

* ✅ **Check pantry and water** — Sundays 5:00pm PT
    
* ✅ **Reorder groceries** — Sundays 6:00pm PT
    
* ✅ **Pick daily energy color** — Every day 7:00am PT
    
* ✅ **Take morning meds** — Every day 9:00am PT
    
* ✅ **Take evening meds** — Every day 9:00pm PT
    
* ✅ **Refill pill case nightly** — Every day 9:15pm PT
    

Want me to add more from the system pack? My top next picks:

* **Kitchen fifths + mop/ice routine** (Mon/Wed/Fri 2:00pm PT)
    
* **Inbox-5** (11:00am & 4:00pm PT)
    
* **Money sweep** (1st of the month 10:00am PT)
    
* **Medical admin hour** (2nd Tue 1:00pm PT)
    

Tell me which ones to turn on (or any tweaks to times/wording), and I’ll wire them up.

* * *

**You:**

Can you do these so that i can easily put them in notion in a way thst will flow into reminders

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

Got it — if the goal is to **flow these into Notion reminders**, the easiest way is to make each automation into a clean **Notion recurring task template**.

Here’s a **ready-to-paste format** (markdown style, which Notion handles well) so your system can sync smoothly:

* * *

# 🛠️ Core Automations for Notion

### ✅ Pantry & Water Check

* **When:** Sundays 5:00pm PT
    
* **What:** Check pantry + water supply.
    
* **Trigger:** If < 3 gallons → place order.
    
* **Tag:** `#supplies #weekly`
    

* * *

### ✅ Grocery Reorder

* **When:** Sundays 6:00pm PT
    
* **What:** Reorder standard grocery cart (swap 1–2 items for variety).
    
* **Tag:** `#food #weekly`
    

* * *

### ✅ Daily Energy Color

* **When:** Every day, 7:00am PT
    
* **What:** Pick daily energy color:
    
    * 🟢 Green (energy 3) → 1 focus + 1 admin + 1 body task
        
    * 🟡 Yellow (energy 2) → 1 focus _or_ 2 micros
        
    * 🔴 Red (energy 0–1) → meds, food, water, shower, inbox-5
        
* **Tag:** `#energy #daily`
    

* * *

### ✅ Morning Meds

* **When:** Every day, 9:00am PT
    
* **What:** Take morning meds.
    
* **Tag:** `#health #daily`
    

* * *

### ✅ Evening Meds

* **When:** Every day, 9:00pm PT
    
* **What:** Take evening meds.
    
* **Tag:** `#health #daily`
    

* * *

### ✅ Nightly Refill

* **When:** Every day, 9:15pm PT
    
* **What:** Refill tomorrow’s pill case + stage water/electrolytes.
    
* **Tag:** `#health #nightly`
    

* * *

💡 How to flow this into Notion reminders:

1. Paste each block into your Notion database (tasks / daily systems page).
    
2. Add a **date property with recurrence** (Notion now supports recurring reminders).
    
3. Use tags (`#daily`, `#weekly`, `#health`, `#supplies`) to group and filter in different dashboards.
    

* * *

Do you want me to **expand this pack** to include the optional ones (Kitchen fifths, Inbox-5, Money sweep, Medical admin hour), formatted the same way so you can drop them straight into Notion too?
