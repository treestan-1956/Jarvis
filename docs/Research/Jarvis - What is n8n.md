### 🔧 What Is n8n?

n8n is a fair-code licensed, source-available automation tool that allows you to create workflows by connecting different applications and services through "nodes." Each node represents a specific action, such as sending an email, fetching data from an API, or processing information. Workflows are triggered by events and can include multiple steps to perform complex tasks.[Hostinger](https://www.hostinger.com/tutorials/what-is-n8n?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

Key features of n8n include:

* **Visual Workflow Builder**: Design workflows using a drag-and-drop interface without writing code.
    
* **Custom Code Integration**: Insert JavaScript or Python code within workflows for advanced customization.
    
* **Extensive Integrations**: Connect with over 400 applications and services, including databases, APIs, and cloud platforms.
    
* **AI Capabilities**: Build AI-powered workflows using native integrations with large language models (LLMs) and tools like LangChain.
    
* **Self-Hosting Option**: Deploy n8n on your own infrastructure for greater control over data and operations.[n8n+3GitHub+3Hostinger+3](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
